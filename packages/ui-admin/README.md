# @catalyst-auth/ui-admin

Composable admin surface built on top of the headless primitives. The shell pairs React Router with
TanStack Query so that persistence is delegated to injected Catalyst SDK clients while maintaining
first-class accessibility defaults and theming tokens.

## Features

- **AdminShell** – bootstraps routing, query caching, and SDK providers.
- **Query hooks** – wrappers around TanStack Query for organisations and signing keys.
- **Theme tokens** – exportable constants for colour, spacing, and typography scales.
- **Storybook** – accessible reference implementations with Testing Library coverage.
