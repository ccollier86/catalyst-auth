# Catalyst UI Packages

The UI workspace ships two complementary packages:

- [`@catalyst-auth/ui-headless`](./headless.md) – headless primitives that expose
  fully-typed state machines for authentication, organisation management, and key operations.
- [`@catalyst-auth/ui-admin`](./admin.md) – an opinionated admin shell that layers routing,
  TanStack Query caches, theming tokens, and accessibility defaults on top of the headless
  primitives.

Consult the [quickstarts](./quickstart.md) for runnable integration examples.
